# Flux-react-boilerplate

This is a [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/) application boilerplate that I created when I was playing around with [this](http://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-react-flux-example) nice example app and experimenting on [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) & [React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/). Basically it profits from [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) & [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and also allows to write ES6 via [6to5](https://6to5.org/).

Usage:
- Install Gulp: ``npm install --global gulp``
- Navigate to folder and install dependencies: ``npm install``
- Run Build: ``gulp build`` (``deploy`` for production, ``watch`` for continuous development)
- Install [httpster](http://httpster.net/): ``npm install --global httpster``
- Navigate to **/build** and run: ``npm httpster``
- [http://localhost:3333/](http://localhost:3333/)
